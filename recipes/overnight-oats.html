    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is absolutely perfect for hectic weeks. In the evening, it takes just a few minutes to make, then you've got a delicious, healthy breakfast ready to eat in the morning. And -- everyone in the family can make it to taste by adding additional toppings or mix-ins.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>This recipe makes 4 servings. Use rolled or regular oats, not quick or instant, as they are too fine and will turn to mush. Similarly, don't use steel-cut, as they will not soften enough.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup milk of choice</li>
            <li>75 mL (1/2 cup) Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. chia seeds</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. sweetener (honey, maple or agave syrup, etc.)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. vanilla or almond extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients.</li>
            <li>You can add mix-ins or toppings now, or wait until the morning. If you do it now, keep in mind that crunchy things will soften and fruit may water a bit.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>In the morning, add a bit more milk if the mixture is too thick for you.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can store the oats in the fridge for up to five days -- the base recipe anyway. If you choose to add mix-ins or toppings during your initial prep, consider whether they will last that long.</li>
            <li>Our favorite mix-ins are dessicated (shredded) coconut, peanut or almond butter.Our favorite toppings are berries, almond slivers (slices), chocolate chips and granola.</li>
        </ul>
