    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza dough does not have to be difficult! This recipe sure isn't. It takes time, yes, but it's nearly all <em>hands off</em> time! Honestly, it takes about 15 inital minutes to make this dough (while the stand mixer does all the hard work), then you can sneak away and relax for hours while everyone else thinks you're grinding away, old-world style.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. quick-rise (instant) yeast</li>
            <li>2 1/4 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/4 c. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups plus 2 tbsp. warm water</li>
            <li>Cornmeal for dusting the pan</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the oil and water and stir until the dough comes together into a shaggy mass. Fit the stand mixer with the dough hook and knead on medium-low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gather the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>When the dough has risen, punch it down and place on a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough in half and roll each piece into a ball.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough balls with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes (the dough will rise a bit). Using your hands, stretch the dough to the desired shape.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F and set an oven rack in the bottom position. Dust a 13x18-inch baking sheet lightly with cornmeal. Place the stretched dough on the baking sheet, and gently stretch it out again so that it maintains its shape.</li>
            <li>Spread your sauce over the dough, leaving a ½-inch border around the edges. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the crust is partially cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and scatter the cheese and toppings over the sauce. Slide the pan back into the oven and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling, 4 to 6 minutes more. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
